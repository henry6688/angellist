Prompt
~~~~~~

Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect
allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to
while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the
other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this
issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

Response
~~~~~~~~
For the deals happened two years ago, I am not so sure if we still need to reach out.
Anyways, assume we do. I will think the under allocated investors will be more angry when they find out.
Assuming reallocating is NOT possible, (since we have to honor it, otherwise the over allocated investors will be furious too).
We could do nothing with the over allocated investor since they got the long end of the stick anyways.
For the under allocated investors, we need to apologize first AND tell them that we can give them 'priority'
during next fund-raising round for those deals. i.e. Guarantee they can invest X amount first. X = their under allocated gap * multiplier
