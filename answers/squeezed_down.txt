Prompt

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

we should explain to the customer politely that this is because we have to distribute the total allocation pool 'fairly'
to many investors who are interested. And the way we are doing it now is according to each
investor's historical average amount.

The biggest problem with the current protation logic is that the big investors (those with a high historical average amount)
always get a larger cut among all aggressive investors. This will cause the big investor gets bigger and those small investors
can hardly take a cut (unless they start investing in low demand start ups first to improve their historical average amount)

We could try these approaches:
   1. Instead weight by historical amount, we could weight by 'request amount'.
      i.e.: all aggressive investors get remain_allocation_amount * their requested amount / total request amount
      so if someone really want to invest, just submit a high request amount.

   2. Assign some priority to investors (i.e.: by their membership status, total fund committed, etc....)
      Then distribute fund by this priority rank

   3. If we really want to stick with weighting by historical invested amount, we could 'bucket' it.
      i.e.: between 100K - 500K give a value of 1, 500K-1M a value of 2, etc...  Weight by this value.
      This way, if two investors falls in the same bucket, they will be given equal amount.
